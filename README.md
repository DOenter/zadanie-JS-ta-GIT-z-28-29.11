# zadanie-JS-ta-GIT-z-28-29.11

I'v been trying to create page with parralax-effect for snow-balls with background of mountains.(But its still to hard for my level)
Also, I tryed to make my home work from GM and MD to test myself in GIT and JS basic functions. Thats the result)

Thank you guys. I hope Il pass that way, with your help.

# Index
had to make a basic thing - this is it)

# Mount Font
Background of all

# js.js
test of js function like in home work of MD 
mouseup, mousedown, mouse...mouse...

# style.css
CSS mix of what i knew and used for that type of project. Not perfect, for sure)

# rwd
connector of style and media

# snowballs
should be cool with parallax. But dont know how to do it. :(

# media
brake-point for "menu" on small monitors and phones.

# pngwing
mountains on right side. Which covering the text from html. I like it)
